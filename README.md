# KWK-Mariana-Castellanos-Computer-Science-diveristy-Challenge
This is the repository containing what  I have worked the past month in regards to understanding and analyzing the patterns in underrepresentation in Hispanic, Latinos and Women in STEM. Using pandas and python libraries, I scrapes, cleaned and visualized data to better understand the patterns in STEM misrepresentation, from AP Comsci enrollment, to workforce race and ethnicity statistics, to wage gaps.

I used csv files from the department of education on school statistics to analyze patterns in AP Computer Science enrollment compared to overall enrollment, which I cleaned and visualized using pandas. I found that a good way to show the inequality of Latinos in Computer Science education was by showing the proportion differences between overall enrollment and AP computer Science enrollment.

I also used Looker Studio in order to visualize more complex data on post graduation statistics. To use looker studio, I first cleaned several files multiple times from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics and ran them on Google Looker until to generate graphics on the distribution of people working in Computer Science fields.

Finally, I used Seaborn and Pandas to clean and visualize salary data from the National Survey of College graudates to analyze the wages of Science and Engineering graduates across sex and Race/Ethnicity.
